## Version update TODO
- Add a new pumping machine to the print list and display the share

- Added miner test. Simulate the mining machine to send tasks by yourself. The simulated server sends packets to the client.
- Adapt to all mining pools. Use a self-written client to simulate all mining pool logins. Then adapt.


- Added automatic disconnection without submitting tasks after login.

DONE - cancel random algorithm, use u64 for counting. When the threshold is reached, it sends an own packet to the client.
###### Important - global atomic is_login bool , rpc_id,

- Separate state to manage itself as multiple states.

## To be verified
- Miners are frequently offline pending verification
- Multi-threading of pumping miners. Prevent a large number of acquisition tasks from not getting tasks. pending verification
- The mining pool only needs one connection TCP or SSL. Local for multi-port adaptation


## BUG
- Miners go online too often. One goes online every 5 seconds. try only 2 on ------------ not working
- Not due to server configuration.

- TODO Write a program that listens. Monitor why the local miner will take the initiative to go offline.
