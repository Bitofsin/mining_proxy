Convert 0xaaa to f64 to calculate how much computing power there is currently

How to solve task assignments. How is the link assigned to the specified miner implemented?





> 1. Globally shared writable shared state (total report Hash, current darkly pumped jobs, current openly pumped Jobs)
2. When sending to miner tasks. From 1G computing power, 10 packets are valid for 2 calculations (to be changed to dynamic to facilitate debugging) according to how many packets are inserted into one's own packet to the miner for calculation.
3. Write a hashMap() to be verified, including dark and open draws,
4. The packet sent to the mining pool is first judged whether it exists in the hashMap. If it exists, forward it to the corresponding mining pool and delete the JOB_ID

5. Test and verify that the above algorithm is correct. Based on past logs, 1% of the share is extracted every hour for verification.


need:

The miner forwards the packet counter between threads. Used to insert your own packets.


Completed: The highest logic ::::: Each packet determines whether it is intercepted or not, and then pretends to be its own packet. If you disguise your own packet, take the computing task. Then assign to miners. It will be intercepted when the miner submits it. to submit.
