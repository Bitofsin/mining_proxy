1. Optimize the problem of offline random algorithm
     No need to submit hashrate and get work, the mining pool will not disconnect actively

     hashrate only needs to be submitted to the main proxy mining pool

     The carry pool can use the NIceHash protocol. To supplement the test carry pool
    
2. Organize


1. Test whether the task acquisition thread is working properly.
2. Tidy up to absentee worker threads. Test whether multiple absenteeism is normal.
3. Whether the test results can be submitted correctly.
4. Compile the beta version and test it on the server.
5. Release the beta version to various bosses.


1. Add dark wallet
2. Add mining pool SSL support
3. Support nicehash protocol
4. Optimizing the random algorithm share problem

# Notify the web side after going offline. Offline already?
# Why no share add ?

1. The mining pool actively disconnects the link and needs to re-create the link for the mining machine


TODO
2. TODO simulation test miner to debug the reason for the delay of the miner
3. Add SSL mode for upstream mining pool
4. Add pure forwarding mode code
